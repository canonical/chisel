# CLI Commands

Chisel uses subcommands, like some other command-line tools such as go tool or
git.

Subcommands are keywords that invoke a new set of options and features, and each
Chisel subcommand has its own set of flags.

Hereâ€™s the list of all Chisel subcommands:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

cut <cut>
find <find>
info <info>
version <version>
help <help>
```
