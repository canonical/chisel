# This Makefile stub allows you to customize starter pack (SP) targets.
# Consider this file as a bridge between your project
# and the starter pack's predefined targets that reside in Makefile.sp.
#
# You can add your own, non-SP targets here or override SP targets
# to fit your project's needs. For example, you can define and use targets
# named "install" or "run", but continue to use SP targets like "sp-install"
# or "sp-run" when working on the documentation.

# Put it first so that "make" without argument is like "make help".
