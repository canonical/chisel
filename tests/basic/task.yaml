summary: Ensure multiple slices (with mutation scripts) are properly installed

environment:
    RELEASE/jammy: 22.04
    RELEASE/focal: 20.04
    RELEASE/mantic: 23.10
    RELEASE/noble: 24.04

execute: |
  rootfs_folder=rootfs_${RELEASE}
  mkdir -p $rootfs_folder
  chisel cut --release ${OS}-${RELEASE} \
    --root $rootfs_folder ca-certificates_data openssl_bins
  
  # make sure $rootfs_folder is not empty
  ls ${rootfs_folder}/*

  # with the ca-certificates mutation script, we can assert that:
  # - etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt is not empty
  # - usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/ does not exist
  test -s ${rootfs_folder}/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt 
  test ! -d ${rootfs_folder}/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla 

  # with the openssl pkg, both internal and external dependencies need to be met, for:
  # - libc6_libs
  # - libc6_config
  # - libssl3_libs
  # - openssl_config
  test -f ${rootfs_folder}/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf
  test -f ${rootfs_folder}/usr/lib/*-linux-*/libssl.so.*
  test -f ${rootfs_folder}/etc/ld.so.conf.d/*-linux-*.conf
  test -f ${rootfs_folder}/lib/*-linux-*/libc.so.*

  # and openssl actually works
  ${rootfs_folder}/usr/bin/openssl
